# music-table
This is a personal project to handle audio effects and music easily with a tablet or laptop. I use this for my children school theater plays. 

It is based on Angular (in fact it is just javascript code that runs in a browser). 
I use this in combination with an HTTP Server on an Android device and open in a local browser on that device. 

You must clone the repo, build the server and modify the JSON file `music-items.json` with the entries you need. The mp3 files shall be located in the `assets\mp3` folder and the names must match exactly.
